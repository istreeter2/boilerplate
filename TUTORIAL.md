GitHub is an online git repository hosting site. Once you create or find a repo you want to contribute to simply copy the repo's clone url.

## Step 2 - Clone the repository

Open your IDE and utilize git through the menu

Simply paste the clone url into the prompt window and click clone.

## Step 3 - Make changes and commit

Make changes to the repo files and watch as git tracks all additions, changes and deletions.

Once you're done commit your changes with the green commit button in the top ribbon.

In the commit window check all the files which you want changes save for, and add a descriptive message of your changes. Once you're done hit the commit button.

## Step 4 - Push changes

Once you commit your changes, you must then push those commits to GitHub, else the changes will only be seen on you computer.

## Step 5 - Pull changes

![Make a pull](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istreeter2/boilerplate/master/img/step_08.PNG "Make a pull")

By clicking the blue arrow button on the top ribbon, you pull all changes from GitHub. These changes are those made by those you are collaborating with.

You'll even see what files were changed remotely!

## Step 6 - Branching

If you think of git as a assembly line, it'd be obvious that you will never want two people working on the same part at the same time. With branching multiple people can work on their portion of a project without worrying about someone else's changes.

Simply click on the Git text label in the bottom ribbon and create a new one to get started.

Give your branch a unique name relevant to what you're doing in the branch

Within this branch you must still commit and push your changes, but your changes will only be reflected in the branch.

## Step 7 - Merging

![Make a branch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istreeter2/boilerplate/master/img/step_12.PNG "Make a branch")

Merge all branches you want tracked in master

## Dealing with merge conflicts

If you have conflicting changes you must manually resolve the change conflicts from the merged branches.

This mini editor simply shows you the different conflicting file versions on the left and right, with the ending result in the middle.

## Changing your git remote url

OPen the remotes prompt from the VCS menu dropdown.

Within the git remotes you can have multiple remote repos but the default is always named origin. You can click the pencil icon to change the url for any remote repo.
